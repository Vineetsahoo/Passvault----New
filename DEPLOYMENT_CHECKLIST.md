## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Fails to Start
1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify MongoDB connection string
3. Ensure all environment variables are set
4. Check if cluster is active in MongoDB Atlas

### If Frontend Can't Reach Backend
1. Verify VITE_API_URL is correct
2. Check CORS configuration in backend
3. Ensure backend is running (not asleep)
4. Check browser Network tab for errors

### If CORS Errors Appear
1. Verify FRONTEND_URL in backend matches exact Vercel URL
2. Check CORS middleware in server.js
3. Ensure no trailing slashes in URLs
4. Redeploy backend after changes

### If MongoDB Connection Fails
1. Check IP whitelist (should be 0.0.0.0/0)
2. Verify username and password
3. Ensure cluster is not paused
4. Test connection string locally first
